Hello all. My name is Chris Grieves. I am a statistician at the Bureau of Labor Statistics working on survey methods for the Current Employment Statistics Survey. While working on large government surveys dedicated to reporting official demographic and economic statistics, there is little room for exploration. It is critical that methods be trusted by those who use the statistics and do not cause a break in series. This presents the problem that better methods of creating estimates and variances may be left at the wayside to preserve the integrity of the series. These newer methods are typically introduced at the inception of a new products and during large changes in surveys that may happen once a decade. In all honestly, this gives the average survey statistician little room to practice their craft.

This brings me to the purpose of this page. I needed a place to practice all these cool ideas I hear about everyday. My goal here is to write about these ideas and present them side by side with an example. I will provide all code and data in github repositories. I intend on mostly using R for my programming, however perhaps I will use Python as well.


I can be contacted at <survey.this.blog@gmail.com>. Hope you enjoy!
